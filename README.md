# TsarChain — The Voice Sovereignty Monetary System

*A proof-of-work, UTXO-based chain built to preserve human voice — uncensorable, durable, and verifiable.*

TsarChain is a minimal, pragmatic Layer-1 focused on **Voice Sovereignty**: protecting speech, art, and testimony so they can’t be silently erased. The project pairs a Python-first core with Rust accelerators where performance matters, and ships a local-first wallet so everyone can participate without gatekeepers.

## ✨ Features at a Glance

- **Consensus** — PoW with LWMA difficulty targeting predictable block times.
- **Ledger model** — UTXO with SegWit serialization and signature validation (secp256k1).
- **Addresses** — Bech32, prefix **`tsar1`** (P2WPKH today; room for scripts/contracts later).
- **Wallet** — “Kremlin” light wallet (GUI) for send/receive, explorer, and secure P2P chat.
- **Secure chat** — X3DH key agreement + Double Ratchet, safety numbers, and key-change alerts.
- **Networking** — Peer discovery with bootstrap support, multi-port range, full block/tx relay.
- **Observability** — Structured logs for node, miner, and wallet.

## 🧭 Why Voice Sovereignty?

Platforms curate history; networks preserve it. TsarChain treats each message, artwork, or testimony as **expressive value** anchored in blocks and protected by open consensus — so proof of speech remains auditable long after timelines move on.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
- Python ≥ 3.11, Git
- (Optional) Rust toolchain for native acceleration

#### Setup
```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -U pip wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### (Optional) Build Native Extension
```bash
pip install maturin
cd tsarcore_native
maturin develop --release

# -- Optional --
maturin develop --release --features parallel

# -- Run Test --
python tests/native_test.py
```
> You can Switch python or native acceleration in [`src/tsarchain/utils/config.py`](src/tsarchain/utils/config.py): set `NATIVE = 0` or `1`.

---

## 🏃🏻‍♂️ Quickstart

**Run a Miner/Node**
```bash
# GUI
python apps/miner_gui.py
# CLI
python apps/cli_miner.py
```

**Run the GUI Wallet**
```bash
python apps/kremlin.py
```

> **Tip:** For public devnet tests, lock `GENESIS_HASH`, keep `ALLOW_AUTO_GENESIS = 0`, enable the chain-work rule and reorg limits, and tune difficulty/LWMA for your network size.

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Chat privacy uses X3DH + Double Ratchet (simple implementation).
- This is experimental software; there haven't been many network security audits, it was built by a **graphics design studio** with little experience in low-level engineering.
- If you run validators/miners publicly, just **mining it!** **fork it!** **learn it!** **Look for vulnerabilities!** and see how blockchain work.

## 🫂 Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Please start with small, well‑scoped changes (docs, tests, logging), then propose larger work via issues. Be respectful: the mission is **Voice Sovereignty**.
> I've provided a logging tool. For easier debugging, you can check `src/tsarchain/utils/tsar_logging.py`
