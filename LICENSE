This software includes an independent implementation of 
end-to-end encryption protocols based on published 
technical specifications of:

- X3DH Key Agreement Protocol
- Double Ratchet Algorithm

These implementations were developed through clean-room 
engineering processes without reference to or derivation 
from any AGPL-licensed source code.

Cryptographic primitives use standard libraries and 
well-established algorithms (X25519, HKDF, AES-GCM).
